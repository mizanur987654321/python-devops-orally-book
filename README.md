## Create a project scaffold
Create cloud based environment/tools such as:
### Colab Notebook - 
* Colab is the same as jupiter notebook, created by Google. This is just an example how to use Google Colab. For more about [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

### GitHub Codespaces
Build out Python Project Scaffold:
* Makefile (it is like a set of recipies or a cook book that can be reproduced when needed) )
* requirements.txt (where we would have list of packages to be installed)
* test_library.py
* python_library 
* Dockerfile (is used to create containers)
* command-line-tool
* Microservice

Build out python project scafold:
* Makefile ($ touch Makefile)
* requirements.txt
* test_library.py
* python_library
* Dockerfile
* command-line-tool
* Microservice

Steps to follow in Codespaces cmd:
* touch Makefile to create an empty file
* touch requirements.txt
* mkdir devopslib
* touch devopslib/__init__.py
* touch hello.py
* touch test_hello.py
* virtualenv ~/.venv (to create a virtual directory under home directory invisibly)

More steps to follow for virtual environment:
More steps to follow for virtual environment:
* Edit  my vim ~/.bashrc (so every time it loads when I will have interpreter)
* to source my python environment source ~/.venv/bin/activate




### AWS CloudShell 
### AWS Cloud9 (which is a full phase cloud based environment)



## Command Lines Tools



## microservices



## Containerized continuous delivery
